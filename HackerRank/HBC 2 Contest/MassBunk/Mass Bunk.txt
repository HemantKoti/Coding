Mass Bunk

Description :
In JNTUH students have planned for mass bunk after a tiresome month of examinations. But the principal of the college is strict, he smartly assigned professors as guides for a set of students. His formula is simple, he ordered all the professors to monitor students who are present within a distance of 'K' from them. So students who are present within this 'K' distance cannot bunk the classes.
You will be given names of the students who are connected with each other, as well as names of the professors who are connected with students.
Your task is very simple, just print the names of all the students who can bunk the classes.
It is assured that no two professors are connected to each other.
(Hint : A professors' name starts with dr)

Input Format : 
First line contains two numbers N and K
Now 'N' lines follow each line containing two names that are separated with certain delimiters.
Note : The delimiters are " ,_." (excluding double quotes).

Constraints : 
1 <= N <= 20000
2 <= length of name <= 20
1 <= K <= 10
Note : Names will only contain lowercase letters and numbers.

Output Format : 
Print the names of all the students who can mass bunk with spaces between them.
If no one can bunk then print -1.
Note : Start printing the names with the student whose name is added first and not within the range to any professor.

Sample input : 
4 2
abhinay srikar
srikar sourabh
sourabh ashok
ashok drsupreethi

Sample output : 
abhinay srikar

Explanation : 
Since drsupreethi is connected with ashok he cannot bunk.
Since the given range of drsupreethi is 2, so sourabh who is connected with ashok cannot bunk as well.
Now people who can bunk are abhinay and srikar, since abhinay is added first in the list, we start printing with abhinay.
