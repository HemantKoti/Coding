Reema and Seema
Reema and Seema are twins who live together and work together. Recently they joined a pyramid scheme to make fortune(A pyramid scheme is where a person recruits two people and inturn asks them to recruit other two people in the organization).

After joining the pyramid scheme their positions differ in the scheme. Since they always stay and work together they must know the distance between their positions so that either one of them can reach out to the other.
Your task is to help reema and seema, by calculating the minimum distance path between their positions in the pyramid scheme. Every person in the scheme is assigned an ID number, you should print the minimum path using these numbers.

Note : Since the pyramid scheme represents a binary tree, we will implement addition of new members for you. Your task is only to print the minimum path.

Input Format : 
First line contains two numbers N and M
Second line contains N integers which represent ID numbers of people in the organization
Now 'M' lines follow each consisting of 2 integers X and Y which represent ID numbers of Reema and Seema

Constraints : 
1 <= N <= 100000
-1000000000 <= X,Y <= 1000000000
1 <= M <= 1000

Output Format : 
For every X and Y print the minimum path from X to Y in a new line.
If either X or Y are not present then print -1.
Note : Start printing the path with the node which has lower value, i.e, if X < Y then start with X else Y.

Sample input : 
15 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
2 5
3 7
11 15
7 13

Sample Output :
2 5
3 7
11 5 2 1 3 7 15
7 3 6 13

Explanation : 
Node since 2 is less than 5 we will start with 2 and print the path between 2 to 5.
Refer the diagram below for least path.
